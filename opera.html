    <h3>The Mikado</h3>
    <h4>ACT II — Ko-Ko's Garden</h4>
    <p>
        <p class="speech">Enter Pitti-Sing and Peep-Bo.</p>
     <h4 class="YUM">YUM</h4>
       <p class="speech"> Yes, everything seems to smile upon me.  I am to be
   married to-day to the man I love best and I believe I am the very
   happiest girl in Japan!</p>
     <h4 class="PEEP">PEEP</h4>
   <p class="speech"> The happiest girl indeed, for she is indeed to be
   envied who has attained happiness in all but perfection.</p>
   <p class="chorus">CHORUS.<br>
              Braid the raven hair—<br>
      Weave the supple tress—<br>
 Deck the maiden fair<br>
      In her loveliness—<br>
 Paint the pretty face—<br>
      Dye the coral lip—<br>
 Emphasize the grace<br>
      Of her ladyship!<br>
 Art and nature, thus allied,
 Go to make a pretty bride.</p>
     <h4 class="YUM">YUM</h4>

   <p class="speech">In "all but" perfection?</p>
        <h4 class="PEEP">PEEP</h4>
      <p class="speech">Well, dear, it can't be denied that the fact that
   your husband is to be beheaded in a month is, in its way, a
   drawback.  It does seem to take the top off it, you know.</p>
     <h4 class="PITTI">PITTI</h4>
   <p class="speech">I don't know about that.  It all depends!</p>
        <h4 class="PEEP">PEEP</h4>
      <p class="speech">At all events, he will find it a drawback.</p>
        <h4 class="PITTI">PITTI</h4>
      <p class="speech">Not necessarily.  Bless you, it all depends!</p>
        <h4 class="YUM">YUM</h4>
      <p class="speech">I think it very indelicate of you to
   refer to such a subject on such a day.  If my married happiness is to be—to be—</p>
   <h3><p class="direction">(in tears).</p></h3>
     <h4 class="PEEP">PEEP</h4>
   <p class="speech">Cut short.</p>
        <h4 class="YUM">YUM</h4>
      <p class="speech">Well, cut short—in a month, can't you let me forget
   it? </p> 
   <h3><p class="direction">(Weeping.)</p></h3>

   <h4>MADRIGAL</h4>

<p class="song">YUM-YUM, PITTI-SING, NANKI-POO, and PISH-TUSH

Brightly dawns our wedding day;<br>
    Joyous hour, we give thee greeting!<br>
    Whither, whither art thou fleeting?<br>
Fickle moment, prithee stay!<br>
    What though mortal joys be hollow?<br>
    Pleasures come, if sorrows follow:<br>
Though the tocsin sound, ere long,<br>
    Ding dong!  Ding dong!<br>
Yet until the shadows fall<br>
Over one and over all,<br>
Sing a merry madrigal—<br>
      A madrigal!<br>
      Fal-la—fal-la! etc.</p>
