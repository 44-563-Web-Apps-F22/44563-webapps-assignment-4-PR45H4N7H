        Enter Pitti-Sing and Peep-Bo.
     <h4>YUM</h4>
        YUM.  Yes, everything seems to smile upon me.  I am to be
   married to-day to the man I love best and I believe I am the very
   happiest girl in Japan!
     <h4>PEEP</h4>
        PEEP.  The happiest girl indeed, for she is indeed to be
   envied who has attained happiness in all but perfection.
     <h4>YUM</h4>

        YUM.  In "all but" perfection?
        <h4>PEEP</h4>
        PEEP.  Well, dear, it can't be denied that the fact that
   your husband is to be beheaded in a month is, in its way, a
   drawback.  It does seem to take the top off it, you know.
     <h4>PITTI</h4>
        PITTI.  I don't know about that.  It all depends!
        <h4>PEEP</h4>
        PEEP.  At all events, he will find it a drawback.
        <h4>PITTI</h4>
        PITTI.  Not necessarily.  Bless you, it all depends!
        <h4>YUM</h4>
        YUM.  <h3>(in tears).</h3>  I think it very indelicate of you to
   refer to such a subject on such a day.  If my married happiness
   is to be—to be—
     <h4>PEEP</h4>
        PEEP.  Cut short.
        <h4>YUM</h4>
        YUM.  Well, cut short—in a month, can't you let me forget
   it?  
   <h3>(Weeping.)</h3>

   <h4>MADRIGAL</h4>

   YUM-YUM, PITTI-SING, NANKI-POO, and PISH-TUSH

Brightly dawns our wedding day;
    Joyous hour, we give thee greeting!
    Whither, whither art thou fleeting?
Fickle moment, prithee stay!
    What though mortal joys be hollow?
    Pleasures come, if sorrows follow:
Though the tocsin sound, ere long,
    Ding dong!  Ding dong!
Yet until the shadows fall
Over one and over all,
Sing a merry madrigal—
      A madrigal!
      Fal-la—fal-la! etc.  
      <h3>(Ending in tears.)</h3>
