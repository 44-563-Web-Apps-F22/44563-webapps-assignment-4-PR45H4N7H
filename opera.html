        Enter Pitti-Sing and Peep-Bo.

        YUM.  Yes, everything seems to smile upon me.  I am to be
   married to-day to the man I love best and I believe I am the very
   happiest girl in Japan!
        PEEP.  The happiest girl indeed, for she is indeed to be
   envied who has attained happiness in all but perfection.
        YUM.  In "all but" perfection?
        PEEP.  Well, dear, it can't be denied that the fact that
   your husband is to be beheaded in a month is, in its way, a
   drawback.  It does seem to take the top off it, you know.
        PITTI.  I don't know about that.  It all depends!
        PEEP.  At all events, he will find it a drawback.
        PITTI.  Not necessarily.  Bless you, it all depends!
        YUM.  (in tears).  I think it very indelicate of you to
   refer to such a subject on such a day.  If my married happiness
   is to be—to be—
        PEEP.  Cut short.
        YUM.  Well, cut short—in a month, can't you let me forget
   it?  (Weeping.)
